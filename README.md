Once logged in on their accounts, they can see their Dashboard Home, which displays both the Pantry List and Pantry Status, as well as the Grocery List.

![Home Dashboard](./public/images/dashboardHomeScreenshot.png)

On the My Pantry page, users can add more items to their pantry, along with the expiry date and see the status of their pantry in the pie chart widget. Underneath, they automatically get two recipe suggestions based on the item that is going off the soonest in their pantry. To the right, they can see the carbon footprint for each item in the pantry.

On the Recipes page, the users can see more recipe suggestions when searching by item, and then add items to their grocery list in the Grocery List page. When clicking on 'Check footprint' next to each item in the grocery list, users can see the carbon footprint.

On the Account Settings page, users can personalise their account by adding a profile image and a username.
